In this <b>Triangular Peg Solitaire</b> you select one of these positions to be a single vacancy as a starting position.

By jumping the total number of pegs is reduced then. All possible starting positions of a 15 hole triangular board shape do definitively allow to finally end up with just one peg remaining on optimal strategy. This class of challenges are referred to as <em>single vacancy to single survivor challenges</em>.

If the single vacancy position matches the position of the survivor these challenges are called a <em>complement challenge</em>. As a tough task you might find out which vacancies do not allow a complement challenge.

Starting with 14 pegs means that 13 jumps result in a single survivor. Nevertheless consecutive jumps with same peg could be performed depending on the board situation obviously. Such chained jumps could be seen as a single move. The question arises to find the best solutions with minimum amount of moves then.

Feel free to find all possible solutions for these different kind of challenges.
